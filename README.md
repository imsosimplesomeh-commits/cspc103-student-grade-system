# Student Information and Grading System

Final project for **CSPC 103 — Object Oriented Programming**  
Notre Dame of Marbel University — CEAC  
**Instructor:** Mrs. Brenda M. Balala, MIT  

---

## Overview

A desktop grading system built with Python, Tkinter, and PostgreSQL (`psycopg2`). It handles student records, class offerings, raw score entry, and automatic grade computation using the standard collegiate rating scale (1.00 to 5.00).

The project separates responsibilities cleanly:

* `models/`: Data definitions for students, teachers, classes, and grades.
* `repositories/`: Database queries and CRUD operations using parameterized PostgreSQL SQL.
* `services/`: Grade calculations, period weighting, and report generation.
* `ui/`: Tkinter interface divided into four functional tabs.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* PostgreSQL 14+ installed and running locally on port 5432
* pgAdmin 4 (recommended for database management)

---

## Database Setup (pgAdmin / PostgreSQL)

1. Open **pgAdmin 4** and connect to your local PostgreSQL server (default port `5432`, user `postgres`).
2. In the Object Explorer on the left, right-click **Databases** > **Create** > **Database...**.
3. Name the database **`Modelo_CSPC103`** and click **Save**.
4. *(Optional)* If your PostgreSQL password differs from the default in `db.py`, set environment variables:
   * `PGHOST`: `localhost`
   * `PGPORT`: `5432`
   * `PGDATABASE`: `Modelo_CSPC103`
   * `PGUSER`: `postgres`
   * `PGPASSWORD`: `<your_password>`

## Installation & Quick Start

1. **Install required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Initialize database tables:**
```bash
python db.py
```
*Creates all tables with `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` and foreign key relationships in `Modelo_CSPC103`.*

3. **Seed sample data:**
```bash
python seed_data.py
```
*Populates the database with subjects, teachers, class offerings, grading periods, enrollments, and realistic distinct scores for Midterm and Finals.*

4. **Launch the application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

5. **Run automated test cases:**
```bash
python test_system.py
```

## Features

* **Tab 1: Management** — Add, edit, search, and delete students, faculty, and academic subjects.
* **Tab 2: Class Offerings & Enrollment** — Set up classes, assign teachers, configure component percentage weights (quizzes, labs, exams), and enroll students.
* **Tab 3: Score Entry & Calculations** — Record component scores per student, compute weighted midterm and final grades, and calculate final ratings.
* **Tab 4: Reports** — Generate printable class rosters, official grade sheets, and individual student grade summaries with text and table export.

## Grading Scale (Philippine / NDMU Collegiate Standard)

* `98.0 – 100.0` : **1.00** (PASSED)
* `95.0 – 97.9` : **1.25** (PASSED)
* `92.0 – 94.9` : **1.50** (PASSED)
* `89.0 – 91.9` : **1.75** (PASSED)
* `86.0 – 88.9` : **2.00** (PASSED)
* `83.0 – 85.9` : **2.25** (PASSED)
* `80.0 – 82.9` : **2.50** (PASSED)
* `77.0 – 79.9` : **2.75** (PASSED)
* `75.0 – 76.9` : **3.00** (PASSED)
* `Below 75.0` : **5.00** (FAILED)
